# chefnextdoor-front

> A Vue.js front-end app for food selling and exchange

This app utilizes the [ChefNextDoorAPI](https://github.com/francepack/ChefNextDoor-API)

This project idea originates from conversations my partner and I had about missing some of the very local food we'd get from the Colorado Springs area. In my partner's case, this came in the form of mothers of her students that somehow knew the best days to bring their food by school. Most often, tamales. But tamale makers aren't the only local food heros out there- ChefNextDoor is a way to connect community Cookers and Eaters who would like to support their communities.

## Project Goals
As a newer developer, I have several goals for this project:
- Utilize a Ruby on Rails backend. I have been learning some Ruby, and excited to try the rails framework.
- User login/auth. While I have implemented simple systems for login, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to practice an authentication pattern via ruby gem jwt_sessions.
- Vue.js. I have built one prior project with Vue and really enjoy the framework, so I wanted to keep my Vue learning going.
- Tailwind.js. I have never used tailwind, but it strikes me that Vue seems to be a great framework for its use. 
- PhotoBucket. User uploaded pictures of the food they make seems fundamental to this idea, so I hope to learn some aws basics to include a photobucket.
